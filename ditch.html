          <h3>Ditch the Popular</h3>November 2020
          <p>
            Content consumption was different at a few kilobytes per second. We only looked up for things that intrigued us. Fast forward to 2020, our mental bandwidth won't allow us to keep up with the free-flowing information. The only itch we now have is to pick up the device.
        </p>
        <p>
          The internet influenced me in many ways. It is a critical component in shaping my world-view. It sometimes created an urge to know more about something that I didn't know existed.
        </p>
        <p>But, I remember the internet to be much bigger than my feeds. So, I've asked myself a few questions. How often do I find an unpopular video or an article about something I don't like? Why (and how) does popular content even become popular? Why is it becoming harder to find infamous stuff?</p>
        <p>
          The answers turned out to be in the addictions to briefed information, platforms that we use, sticking to the familiar and popular content, and the influence it has on us. The creation of the content is intertwined with the consumption of it, and it gets harder to find useful but unpopular stuff if we keep valuing the popular. We need to think beyond the conventional metrics like most-popular and most-liked.
        </p>
        <p>
          People made fortunes by protecting information. Now that most of it is free, polishing is a way to capitalize on it. Polishing is hard for an individual but is easier on an aggregate level. Popular content that we often come across passes through a lot of human filters. A noticeable flaw is that polishers search for different ways to make it look good and remove details that do not interest them. On-demand content creation changes the whole landscape of consumption. Billions of dollars are being spent on knowing the trends and producing content based on the buzzing keywords.
        </p>
        <p>
          After all, It certainly makes sense to work on popular things. But the whole social phenomenon can gradually boil down a 500-page text into a single picture. The one-size-fits-all images can be tricky. A picture is worth a thousand words. Yet, we cannot derive a 1000 word text from it just by looking at it. Our understanding is limited by how we see the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          Stuff that fits into the world view of more people goes trending, and everyone then starts saying the same thing, not because they all have the same opinion. But because everyone's saying it. We don’t want to be insulted for not knowing stuff everyone’s talking about. After all, everyone saying the same thing will make it sound like common sense. Not knowing what’s perceived as common sense is risky. We value stuff that fits our world-view. But what forms our world-view is more likely the stuff we consumed initially.
        </p>
        <p>
          Popularity also restricts our stars. It demands them to say safe things. When whatever you say draws a lot of attention, you cannot say seemingly contradictory things. One way to escape from that is to remain silent and tweet birthday wishes. So, it turns out that there will be nothing new with our stars.
        </p>
        <p>
          What's more effective than popular content and click-baits is the stuff that is 'recommended for you.' The platforms on which we consume content don’t want us to leave. A brilliant tactic to keep you hooked is to show stuff you love. The more you engage with content, the more they know about you. And gradually, your feeds get narrowed down to what you like.
        </p>
        <p>
          This can be seen more with news and politics. Surprisingly (or not), people trust sources that report what they want to hear. Having an opinion is the new cool. We always categorize stuff into right or wrong. More opinions mean more clashes. The more contradictory something gets, the more you’ll be surrounded by content you love. Believing is more comfortable and takes less time than a mathematical assessment.
        </p>
        <p>
          We search for ways to support what we believe. Often, the reason for the cyber-fight is the belief-system and not the new reform. People who support X do not want to believe in the positive news about Y. So, they find fact-checkers to be on their side.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fact-checkers cannot become popular because they do their investigation 'after' stuff gets viral. A fact cannot go viral because it merely tells us if the viral news is true or false. Fact-checkers cannot come up with clickbaity headlines like, 'The politician is a cold-blooded liar.'
        </p>
        <p>
          What platforms can sense about is not just limited to the shopping recommendations. We'll sometimes never know we're being targeted. Cookies are bad. Private mode is an antidote.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even if algorithms keep finding new ways to eliminate manipulators, it’s easy to find a way to bypass and come up with pretty appealing stuff.
        </p>
        <p>
          A seemingly counterintuitive way to avoid the Popular and ‘tuned for you’ content is to dilute it by deliberately creating more original stuff. And actively avoiding things just because they are popular.
        </p>
        <p>
          With unpopular stuff, Exploring may take more time. And a Google search may not yield results that are as exciting as some random page on the wiki. Loading our feeds with more stuff works too. When you subscribe to every interesting thing you come across, the post on the top of your feed will most likely be random.
        </p>
        <p>
          Information is not a commodity. We can’t make use of everything we know. And we’ll never know what’s useful. Ideas won’t come with a tag on them. Things that make you think don’t necessarily have to be right. But the things that make you believe have to be right. And most of the time, they’re wrong. We have to prioritize content that makes us think.
