      <blockquote>
        "Reality is neutral. Our reactions reflect back and create our world. <br>
        Judge, and feel separate and lonely. Anger, and lose peace of mind. Cling, and live in anxiety. Fantasize, and miss the present. Desire, and suffer until you have it. <br>
        Heaven and hell are right here, right now."
        <br>- Naval Ravikant

      <blockquote>
        "When they examine the actual content of counterfactual thinking, researchers find that individuals tend to focus on aspects of a situation that are under their control. When asked to imagine an automobile accident that involves someone who is speeding while driving on a rainy day with poor visibility, respondents are much more likely to “undo” the accident by having the driver be more cautious than by having the day be clear and dry."
        <br>- 'The Paradox of Choice', Barry Schwartz
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        "One heuristic for distinguishing stuff that matters is to ask yourself whether you'll care about it in the future. Fake stuff that matters usually has a sharp peak of seeming to matter. That's how it tricks you. The area under the curve is small, but it’s shape jabs into your consciousness like a pin."
        <br>- Paul Graham

      <blockquote>
        "Perfect closes the door. It asserts that we're done, that this is the best we can do.<br> Worse, perfect forbids us to try. To seek perfection and not reach it is a failure." <br> - 'This is Marketing', Seth Godin
