        “I write jokes for a living, I sit at my hotel at night, I think of something that's funny, then I go get a pen and I write it down. Or if the pen is too far away, I have to convince myself that what I thought of ain't funny.”

      <blockquote>
      "Some criticism is priceless. It comes from someone who understands the genre and has seen the dynamics at play. It is delivered by someone who feels the fear (for themselves and for you) but decides to show up regardless."
      <br>- Seth Godin
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        "All too often, what matters is not whether an idea is true or effective, but whether it fits with the preconceptions of a dominant cabal."

      <blockquote>
        "Let us conjecture that the formation of moral values in society doesn’t come from the evolution of the consensus. No, it is the most intolerant person who imposes virtue on others precisely because of that intolerance. The same can apply to civil rights."<br>

      <blockquote>
        "Reality is neutral. Our reactions reflect back and create our world. <br>
        Judge, and feel separate and lonely. Anger, and lose peace of mind. Cling, and live in anxiety. Fantasize, and miss the present. Desire, and suffer until you have it. <br>

      </blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        I had, also, during many years, followed a golden rule, namely, that whenever a published fact, a new observation or thought came across me, which was opposed to my general results, to make a memorandum of it without fail and at once; for I had found by experience that <i>such facts and thoughts were far more apt to escape from memory than favorable ones</i>.

      </blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        "When they examine the actual content of counterfactual thinking, researchers find that individuals tend to focus on aspects of a situation that are under their control. When asked to imagine an automobile accident that involves someone who is speeding while driving on a rainy day with poor visibility, respondents are much more likely to “undo” the accident by having the driver be more cautious than by having the day be clear and dry."
        <br>- 'The Paradox of Choice', Barry Schwartz

      </blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        "One heuristic for distinguishing stuff that matters is to ask yourself whether you'll care about it in the future. Fake stuff that matters usually has a sharp peak of seeming to matter. That's how it tricks you. The area under the curve is small, but it’s shape jabs into your consciousness like a pin."
        <br>- Paul Graham
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        "If previously, if traditionally people built identities like stone houses with very deep foundations, now it makes more sense to build identities like tents that you can fold and move elsewhere." <br> - Yuval Noah Harari

      <blockquote>
        "Perfect closes the door. It asserts that we're done, that this is the best we can do.<br> Worse, perfect forbids us to try. To seek perfection and not reach it is a failure." <br> - 'This is Marketing', Seth Godin
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote>
      "A man has many social selves as there are distinct groups of persons about whose opinion he cares. He generally shows a different side of himself to each of these different groups."
